_Simple Parser Generator_ is a small tool for creating parsers for C++, and maybe sometime, other
languages.

## Background

It's just a Python script, created for the Nova project. I didn't find any existing toolkit enough
easy to install and use so I end up creating my own. It's still fun anyway.

## Requirements

The script requires Python 3.

## Development

This project is in development, it doesn't even fulfill its goal, so don't use it. Yet.

## License

This projects use the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).
