_Simple Parser Generator_ is a small tool for creating parsers for C++, and maybe someday, other languages.

## Background

It's a Python script, created originally for my own compiler project. I didn't find any existing toolkit enough easy to install and use so I end up creating my own. It has been fun anyway.

## Requirements

The script requires Python 3.

## Development

Current version: 0.1.0-alpha

This project is in development, in an alpha phase, and it doesn't even fulfil its goal, so don't use it. Yet.

## License

This projects use the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).
